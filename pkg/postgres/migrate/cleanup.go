Cleanup has been started successfully.

To monitor the cleanup, run the following command:
	kubectl logs -f -l %s -n %s

The cleanup will take some time to complete, you can check completion status with the following command:
	kubectl get job %s -n %s

When cleanup is complete, the old instance has been deleted and the migration is complete.
Congratulations, you're all done! ðŸŽ‰
